# Changelog

All notable changes to OAK Healthy are documented here. The project follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and uses semantic
versioning where practical.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Cross-platform AES-GCM interoperability and revision validation tests.
- In-app sync security guidance, unlink controls, and protected key display.
- Durable iOS notification actions for Taken and Skipped dose events.
- Public contribution, governance, security, and roadmap documentation.

### Changed

- Firebase payload and revision reads are now atomic snapshots.
- Firebase writes now use compare-and-set transactions with monotonic revisions.
- Android and iOS sync settings now separate pending Link Code input from the
  active link.
- Three-tab navigation, filters, app icon, and loading identity were redesigned
  consistently across Android and iOS.
- Android card rendering and accessibility semantics were streamlined to reduce
  scroll frame spikes on physical devices.
- iOS simulator Debug builds use ad-hoc signing so Keychain-backed encryption
  tests run under GitHub Actions without changing unsigned Release archives.

### Security

- Malformed encryption envelopes now fail closed.
- Firebase identifiers and encryption key IDs are validated before use.
- In-place encryption-key rotation was removed to prevent inaccessible cloud
  data.
- Firebase database rules now validate node shape, payload size, and strictly
  increasing revisions.
